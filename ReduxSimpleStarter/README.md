NOTES

Component: A collection of JavaScript functions that produce HTML

State: A plan JavaScript object used to record and react to user events. Each Class based component has its own state object. Whenever a components state is changed, the component and all its children are forced to re-render.

Controlled field/component: A form element whose value is set by state, not the other way around. In an ideal world, the state should tell the input what value to be.

Downwards data flow: Only the most "parent" of the components should be responsible for fetching data.
